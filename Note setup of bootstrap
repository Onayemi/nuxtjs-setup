Installing Bootstrap

npm install bootstrap@next   ===> bootstrap 5

npm install --save bootstrap bootstrap-vue

// add bootstrap-vue module for nuxt
  modules: ['bootstrap-vue/nuxt', ...],

npm i -D webpack@^4.46.0

Anyway, we just need one file from the js folder. The name of that file is bootstrap.bundle.min.js It has not only all the js files but ‘popper’ is included. From the webpack page of the documentation, you will know that “Bootstrap depends on Popper, which is specified in the peer dependencies property. This means that you will have to make sure to add it to your package.json using npm install @popperjs/core.” But as we are using ‘bootstrap.bundle.min.js’, we will not need to install popper.
Anyway, copy that ‘bootstrap.bundle.min.js’ and paste that file on your nuxt project’s static folder. Then you need to edit your nuxt.config.js to use it.

script: [
 {
 src: ‘/bootstrap.bundle.min.js’,
 }
 ]
